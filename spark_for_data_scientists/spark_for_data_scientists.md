# Spark for Data Scientists


## Target Audience

***Data scientists*** and ***ML software engineers*** with experience in local data science frameworks (such as sklearn, pandas ,seaborn) yet no extensive experience with spark.

## Abstract

While most of the data scientists are capable of handling python or R frameworks to solve Data Science and ML problems, we bump into some mental obstacles before solving problems using Spark. This talk goal is to **bring spark down to earth**.

## Agenda

- Outline the **Data Science workflow**.
- Understand Sparkâ€™s place in the **Data Science ecosystem**.
- Apply the Data Science workflow using **Spark hands-on** (while comparing to local frameworks).
